    This library is in pre-alpha stage and is not yet suitable for production usage.

  <p>
    Providers bind data sources to widgets. They leverage <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/data/context/">Lit's Context</a> in order to manage a subtree of components.
  </p>

  <p>
    Several providers are given for demo purposes, such as the <span class="code">RandomProvider</span>.
    In general, end users should write their own providers to bind their APIs and data sources to the widgets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some financial data vendors provide robust Data APIs, so this library supports a few of those, such as the <span class="code">PolygonProvider</span>.
