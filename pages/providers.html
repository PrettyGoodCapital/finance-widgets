  <p>
    Providers bind data sources/sinks to widgets. They leverage <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/data/context/">Lit's Context</a> in order to manage a subtree of components.
  </p>

  <p>
    Providers can implement one or more sets of interfaces, which themselves can be applied to any number of widgets.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="code">Single Component Provider</span> (see <a href="#components">Components</a>) - Provides data about a single asset
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="code">Portfolio Component Provider</span> (see <a href="#components">Components</a>) - Provides a collection of data, such as quotes for all assets in a basket
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="code">Single Component Target</span> - Receives a single piece of data, such as a single order to place
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="code">Portfolio Component Target</span> - Receives a collection of data, such as a basket of orders to place
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <p>
    Several providers are given for demo purposes, such as the <span class="code">RandomProvider</span>.
    In general, end users should write their own providers to bind their APIs and data sources to the widgets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some financial data vendors provide robust Data APIs, so this library supports a few of those, such as the <span class="code">PolygonProvider</span>.
